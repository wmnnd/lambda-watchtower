# lambda-watchtower
`lambda-watchtower` is a script for monitoring one or several HTTP(S) endpoints with AWS Lambda.
Logs are stored as AWS CloudWatch metrics.

# Usage
`lambda-watchtower` supports the following event parameters:
```(javascript)
{
  "targets": [
    {
      "url": "https://example.org",
      "name": "example.org", //Optional, defaults to url; Display name of the target
    },
	{
	  "name": "Mailserver SMTP port check",
	  "type": "port",
	  "hostname": "mailserver.example.org",
	  "port": 25
	}
  ],
  "namespace": "Watchtower", //Optional, defaults to "Watchtower"; CloudWatch namespace
  "logTimings": ["readable", "total"], Optional, defaults to ["readable", "total"]; Determine which timings are logged.
  "timeout": 2000 //Optional, defaults to 2000: Time in ms before requests are aborted
}
```

## Supported Timings
The following timings are supported and can be logged by `lambda-watchtower`:

- `lookup`: Time between beginning of request and successful DNS lookup
- `connect`: Time between DNS lookup and TCP connect
- `secureConnect`: Time between TCP connect and completion of HTTPS handshake
- `readable`: Time between successfully establishing the connection (and HTTPS handshake) and first byte received
- `close`: Time between first byte and the end of the request
- `total`: Total time from the beginning to the end of the request


# Setup
There is a detailed step-by-step guide explaining how to set up `lambda-watchtower`. [Read the step-by-step instructions](https://medium.com/@pentacent/serverless-monitoring-of-apps-websites-with-aws-lambda-5431e6713a66).

If youâ€™re already familiar with AWS IAM and Lambda, here is the short version for you:

 1. Create a new IAM Role for Lambda with `PutMetricData` permissions for CloudWatch
 2. Create a new Lambda Function with the contents of `index.js` assign the IAM role created above to this function.
 3. Create a new CloudWatch Event Rule of type schedule.
 4. Select how often you would like to check your endpoints.
 5. Add the new Lambda function as the target.
 6. Configure the input of the target and select "Constant (JSON text)".
 7. Put the configuration JSON (see [Usage](#usage)) in the input field.
 8. Save everything and give it a few minutes. New CloudWatch metrics can take a little while to show up.
